Team,

As we strive to increase our CASCO sales, we must address some identified issues from our recent data:

- D100 (DE, Bronze): conversion 4.7%, revenue trend -2%, risk 100%
- D103 (DE, Bronze): conversion 4.6%, revenue trend +5%, risk 98%
- D105 (DE, Bronze): conversion 6.2%, revenue trend -6%, risk 39%

To tackle these challenges, here are some immediate directions for the team:

1. **Faster Follow-Up Calls**: Make follow-up calls within 24 hours of initial contact to maintain engagement.
2. **Highlight Promotions**: Inform customers about any ongoing promotions related to CASCO to incentivize purchases.
3. **Track Daily Targets**: Set and review daily sales targets to stay focused on increasing CASCO sales.

Why it matters: Every effort we make today can lead to greater success tomorrow. Let's stay motivated and drive those sales!
